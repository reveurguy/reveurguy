- 🏫 I'm currently a student pursuing Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Delhi University graduating in 2023. I'm a **GDSC Lead**, previous HackClub Lead at my campus. I'm **Google Cloud Certified: Cloud Digital Leader**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Web Development** and **Cloud Native Technologies and Tools**. Currently exploring **Typescript and Next.js** along with **Kubernetes**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on open-source projects within **CNCF** and other areas as well.

- ✨ As a lifelong learner, I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. My recent work has involved contributing to open-source projects such as Jenkins and various CNCF projects such as Porter, Keda, and Containerd.

- 🎯 My goal is to collaborate with other developers and contribute to the growth of the technology community. I believe that open-source projects are a great way to build new skills, share knowledge, and make a positive impact.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects. If you're looking to collaborate on a project or just want to connect, feel free to reach out at **reveur.guy99@gmail.com**. I'd love to hear from you!

- 👨‍💻 **Open-Source Contibutor** in [**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/) and many CNCF projects like [**Porter,**](https://getporter.org/) [**Keda,**](https://keda.sh/) [**Containerd**](https://containerd.io/) etc. <br>
  I also built a new website for **[AOSSIE( GSOC Organisation )](https://aossie.org)** from scratch.
